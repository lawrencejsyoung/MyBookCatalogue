This application was created for my final project for Java Programming 2 (PROG24178) course.
When you run the application you’ll be introduced to a welcome screen that contains a single button called
"Enter app".

Clicking the “Enter App” button will launch the main screen that contains two major areas (panels): “Single Book” 
and “All Book Records”.  Selecting a book in the right panel (TableView) the information for that particular wine will 
be displayed in the left panel.

At the top of the main panel there is a menu bar that contains one menu (“File”) that contains a option to return
to the home page or exit the application.

The left panel contains three buttons: “Save”, “Update” and “Reset”.
Save button is used to save (add) a new book record.

Update button is used to update the record for a particular book. You can change any of 
the fields. Reset button resets the text field and combo boxes in the Single Book Record pane.

Search button gives the option to search for available books based on two criteria: title, or author. After selecting the criteria and clicking OK, you’ll be prompted to enter a value for that criteria 
and click OK again. After that the search function displays the number of wines that are available based on that search.
Delete deletes a book record. You must select first the book you want to delete in the table view.


Exit button (as well as File -> Exit) exits the application.
